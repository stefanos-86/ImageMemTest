# This demo requires strong cooperation of the user.
#
# The user must check (with an external clock) how much time passes from the 1st instant he moves the marker to
# the moment he presses a key to terminate the experiment.
# Then he must compare it with the time recorded in the results file.
#
# Another test is to press a key (except Escape) without moving the marker: there should be an exception.

PrepareMarkers("Marker.jpg", "time on marker movement") # Starts the chronometer only when the user moves the markers.
